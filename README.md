# Riker - Containerized reconnaisance

Riker is a web app that boldly goes into a container.

By default, Riker listens on 8080, unless you set the `PORT` environment variable.

## Getting Riker

Riker is available as part of:

docker:///onsi/away-team

(see the [away-team](https://github.com/1701-diego/away-team) repo)

Or as a stand-alone tarball at:

http://onsi-public.s3.amazonaws.com/riker.tar.gz

Examples of deploying Riker are in [Laforge](https://github.com/1701-diego/laforge)
